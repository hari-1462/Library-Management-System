        A library is a collection of materials, books or media that are accessible for use and not just for display purposes.
         A library provides physical (hard copies) or digital access (soft copies) materials, and may be a physical location or a virtual space, or both. 
         A library's collection can include printed materials which can be borrowed, or for reference only 
         (books, documents and other physical publications which are not permitted to leave the library and can only be viewed inside the library) and other physical resources in many formats,
          such as commercial releases of films, television programmes, 
         other video recordings, radio, music and audio recordings on DVD, Blu-ray, CD and cassette as well as access to information, music or other content held on bibliographic databases.

        A library, which may vary widely in size, may be organized for use and maintained by a public body such as a government; an institution such as a school or museum; a corporation; or a private individual. 
        In addition to providing materials, libraries also provide the services of librarians who are trained and experts at finding, selecting, circulating and organizing information and at interpreting information needs, 
        navigating and analyzing very large amounts of information with a variety of resources.
      
        The history of libraries began with the first efforts to organize collections of documents.[2] The first libraries consisted of archives of the earliest form of writing—the clay tablets in cuneiform script discovered in Sumer, some dating back to 2600 BC.
        Private or personal libraries made up of written books appeared in classical Greece in the 5th century BC.
       In the 6th century, at the very close of the Classical period, the great libraries of the Mediterranean world remained those of Constantinople and Alexandria.

        The Fatimids (r. 909–1171) also possessed many great libraries within their domains. The historian Ibn Abi Tayyi’ describes their palace library, which probably contained the largest collection of literature on earth at the time, as a "wonder of the world". 
        Throughout history, along with bloody massacres, the destruction of libraries has been critical for conquerors who wish to destroy every trace of the vanquished community's recorded memory. A prominent example of this can be found in the Mongol massacre of the Nizaris at Alamut in 1256 and the torching of their library,
         "the fame of which", boasts the conqueror Juwayni, "had spread throughout the world".
